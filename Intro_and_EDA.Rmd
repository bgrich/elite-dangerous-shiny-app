The Elite: Dangerous Database (EDDB) is a collection of data for the game 
Elite: Dangerous. The data is split into several different databases: 

* Prices of goods (listings.csv)
* Stations (stations.json)
* Populated Systems (systems_populated.json)
* Factions (factions,json)
* Commodities (commodities.json)
* Modules (modules.json)

This notebook will be an introduction to each data set and provide some 
exploratory data analysis of the data sets. This EDA will also act as 
prototypes for the information I will want to display in the Shiny app.
